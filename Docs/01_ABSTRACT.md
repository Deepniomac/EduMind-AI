\# EduMind – AI Powered Adaptive Study Assistant(25-01-26)



\## Abstract



EduMind is a full-stack web-based AI-powered study assistant platform designed to provide structured, adaptive, and personalized learning support for students. Unlike traditional AI chatbots that only answer user questions, the proposed system focuses on managing the complete learning workflow, including topic explanation, adaptive testing, performance analysis, and revision planning.



The system is developed using a modern web architecture consisting of a React-based frontend and a Python FastAPI backend. The frontend provides an interactive user interface for students, while the backend handles the core logic and communicates with AI models for intelligent content generation.



The novelty of the project lies in its adaptive learning cycle, where the system continuously adjusts the learning strategy based on the student’s performance, difficulty level, and progress history. The proposed approach follows a closed-loop learning model: Learn → Test → Analyze → Adjust → Re-learn, making the platform more effective than conventional one-time response-based AI systems.



This project aims to improve learning efficiency, revision effectiveness, and conceptual understanding by introducing a structured, performance-driven AI-assisted study methodology.
